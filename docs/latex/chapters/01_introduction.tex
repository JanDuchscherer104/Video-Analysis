\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

\section{Context and Motivation}
\label{sec:introduction_context}
Elucidation of the criticality of robust trajectory forecasting for autonomous systems, particularly in scenarios involving dense and interactive multi-agent dynamics. Discussion of the limitations of unimodal prediction and the necessity for probabilistic, multimodal approaches.

\section{Research Objectives}
\label{sec:introduction_objectives}
Statement of the primary research objective: a systematic investigation and implementation of the MTR model for multimodal trajectory prediction, leveraging the UniTraj framework for standardized dataset handling and evaluation. Contributions include {[e.g., "the adaptation of MTR to the UniTraj data processing pipeline", "a comprehensive performance evaluation on benchmark datasets", and "an analysis of challenges encountered within the UniTraj ecosystem"].}

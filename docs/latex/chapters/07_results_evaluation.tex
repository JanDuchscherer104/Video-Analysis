\label{ch:results}

\section{Quantitative Performance Analysis}
\label{sec:results_quantitative}
Presentation and statistical analysis of validation metrics (brier-minFDE, minFDE, minADE, Miss Rate). Add actual results, tables, figures.
Comparison against reported benchmarks (e.g., UniTraj paper results ), with careful consideration of comparability.

\section{Qualitative Analysis and Sample Case Illustration}
\label{sec:results_qualitative}
Detailed deconstruction of prediction examples (cf. presentation slides 10, 15 [cite: 13, 21]), identifying ego agent, other agents, ground truth trajectories, and probabilistic forecasted paths. Analysis of the influence of map topology (lanes, crosswalks) on predicted modalities.
Examination of model predictions in critical scenarios (e.g., agent behavior at intersections or pedestrian crossings), linking observed outputs to specific input features and model mechanisms.

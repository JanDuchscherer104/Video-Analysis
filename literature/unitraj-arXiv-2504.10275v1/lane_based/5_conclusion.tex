\section{Conclusion}
The paper introduces a transformer-based motion prediction module and tackles several important challenges such as trajectory refinement and lane attention. Our work establishes that lanes are the most important components in the static context for prediction tasks. Although LMFormer quantitatively achieves SOTA performance, the qualitative results show that further improvements are needed to address robustness in prediction diversity. We also note that the current evaluation benchmarks are limited in scope and could benefit from additional metrics for velocity profiles and predicted paths. Our cross-dataset evaluation highlights a potential limitation of training on intersection-centric data when generalizing to broader urban driving scenarios, but this issue could be overcome by combining samples from individual datasets.
